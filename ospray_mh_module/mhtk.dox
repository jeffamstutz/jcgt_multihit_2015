  \section Introduction

  Experimental module to provide some intial 'multi-hit traversal
  kernel' for certain kinds of simulations that do not want to find
  only the 'nearest' hit -- or 'any hit' -- along a ray, but rather
  need the nearest 'N' such hit points along a ray.

  This module comes as a loadable plugin that provides:

  - an interface and implementation for a multi-hit kernel
    functionality, for both C and ISPC (see
    multihit_kernel.[h,ih,cpp,ispc])

  - a simple 'xray' viewer that demonstrates the use of the multi-hit
    kernel by using it to find N hitpoints along each ray, and doing
    some kind of volume rendering effect; again in both C and ISPC
    variants (see xray_renderer.[h,ih,cpp,iscp])

  - a loadable module (libospray_module_mhtk) that can be used
    together with the msgView demo app, and that exports the renderers
    'mhtk_xray_scalar' and 'mhtk_xray_ispc'. Call via
    <code>
    ./msgView --module mhtk <objfile> --renderer mhtk_xray_scalar
    </code>
